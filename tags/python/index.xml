      <description>About The Introduction to Machine Learning Crash course, from Google which teaches Machine Learning Fundamentals using TensorFlow is a popular and brilliant way to begin Machine Learning. I took this self-paced over the time of a few weeks in 2018 and took some notes as I went.
This blog post are my summary notes for that course. In addition to taking notes for the course, I also put together a playlist for all the videos of that course, for those who prefer to learn solely from YouTube.</description>
