I work at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. Previously, I have worked at CloudFactory, and several early stage startups.

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Luther College in 2021. While in college, I ran the <a href="https://luthercss.github.io" target="_blank">ACM Luther College</a>. 

## Principles 

I believe that an organization should be guided by a set of core values that each member of that organization can look towards to find guidance. Here are some values that resonate with me:

1. Workers should take ownership of their work, and be able to find pride in what they do. 
2. Long term-value should not be sacrificed for short term results. 
3. Standards for what is acceptable should be high. 
4. Team members should be curious and should consistently learn and improve themselves. Learning is a constant, iterative, and lifelong process.
5. Everyone, regardless of differences should be treated with dignity. 
6. Teams should be open to new ideas. Innovation should not be limited by a mentality of "I'm not used to it".
7. Building trust is important, and trust begins with transparency.
